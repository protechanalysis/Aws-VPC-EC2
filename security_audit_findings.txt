Security & Best Practice Audit Findings

Credential Exposure
- No hardcoded AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys, tokens, passwords, or private keys) were found in the Terraform codebase or documentation.
- References to `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are only present as usage instructions in documentation, not as actual values.
- The `.terraform/terraform.tfstate` file contains null values for `access_key`, `secret_key`, and `token`, which is expected and not a risk.

Best Practice Review
- AWS credentials are not stored in code. Documentation instructs users to use environment variables or `aws configure`.
- There is a clear recommendation to store credentials as repository secrets for CI/CD, not in code.
- No sensitive values are present in the README or other documentation.
- The project uses modules for separation of concerns and reusability.
- S3 buckets are configured with encryption, lifecycle, and public access blocks.
- Security groups are defined with variables for ingress/egress, supporting least-privilege access.
- IAM roles and policies are used for EC2 and VPC Flow Logs.
- Remote backend is configured for state management (backend_s3.tf).
- The README includes security best practices and CI/CD guidance.

Recommendations
- Continue to avoid committing any `.tfvars` files with secrets or credentials.
- Add `.tfvars` and `.tfstate` to `.gitignore` if not already present.
- Regularly review state files and CI/CD logs for accidental secret exposure.
- Use IAM roles and environment variables for all automation and local runs.

Result:
No credential exposure detected. Best practices are being followed.
